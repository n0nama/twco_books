You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**NOTE: A few libraries in this app (such as Formsy) haven't updated for a further version of React. In this case, there can be a few warning messages, which recommend updating old methods with UNSAFE_ prefix. I believe that the developers will update it soon. If it necessary:

#### `npx react-codemod rename-unsafe-lifecycles`
