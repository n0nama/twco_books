The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**NOTE: A few libraries in this app (such as Formsy) haven't updated for a futher version of React.
In this case there can be a few warning messages, which recommend to update old methods with UNSAFE_ prefix.
I believe that the developers will update it soon.
If it necessary:

## `npx react-codemod rename-unsafe-lifecycles`
